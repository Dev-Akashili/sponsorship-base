# Backend

The application stack interacts with a PostgreSQL Server database, and uses code-first migrations for managing the database schema.

The repository contains a `docker-compose` for the database, so just run `docker-compose up -d` to start it running.

When setting up a new environment, or running a newer version of the codebase if there have been schema changes, you need to run migrations against your database server.

The easiest way is using the dotnet cli:

1. If you haven't already, install the local Entity Framework tooling

- Anywhere in the repo: `dotnet tool restore`

1. Navigate to the same directory as `SponsorshipBase.csproj`
1. Run migrations:

- `dotnet ef database update -s SponsorshipBase`
- The above runs against the default local server, using the connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`
- You can specify a connection string with the `--connection "<connection string>"` option

## Backend App Configuration

The app can be configured in any standard way an ASP.NET Core application can. Typically from an `appsettings.json`.

## Email Verification

Verification emails sent by the `Account Controller` for auth uses **EmailJS**. The credentials are stored in `appsettings.Development.json`. Kindly request for the credentials (public key, service id and template id) to set up your local repo.

```bash
  "EmailJS": {
    "ServiceId": "service_hunen6a",
    "RegisterTemplateId": "template_wgqju57",
    "ResetTemplateId": "template_j9dhivf",
    "Key": "2OdOhAdreljr98Bpk"
   }
```
